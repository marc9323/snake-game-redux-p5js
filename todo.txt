1.) Implement cell by cell movement.  Stop moving when key released.
Move only one cell.
-- keyReleased setDir(0, 0);

2.)  Use the mouse to move the snake.  Any direction.

3.)  Make food a class.  base and child classes for types
of food.  Food types for powerups that alter snake behavior.

4.)  My snake eats the food and grows but when food is eaten
need to test the type of food.  Wrong color = gameOver.
LastFood = newLevel()

5.)  The first element of the snakes body visually
is the last element of the array.  The last element
of the array is the head.  The first [0] element of the array
is the tail.

my bounds checking was failing because I was checking length - 1
element.  That is the element AFTER the head.
